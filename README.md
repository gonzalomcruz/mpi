# MPI examples for C and Python

This repository contains (will do) a set of examples implemented in C and Python.

I will keep adding new examples to the collection ranging from basic MPI routines to complex examples (dynamic process management, linear algebra, matrix operations, etc.) so stay tuned!

In order to run these examples you will need the following APT packages:

* mpich2
* python-dev
* python-pip
* zlib1g-dev

And the mpi4pi PIP package:

* mpi4pi
